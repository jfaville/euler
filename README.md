# Project Euler Solutions
![Progress on Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/profile/jfaville.png)

This repository contains solutions to miscellaneous problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

### Programming Languages
Solutions are written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) and in Python 3, and are separated by language into two subdirectories. The easiest way to the CoffeeScript files is with the ``coffee`` command (see [this guide](http://coffeescript.org/#installation)) for installation details), but they can also be compiled to Javascript files.

### Status Report
These solutions were all made for fun, and are able to produce the correct answer in a timely fashion. In some solutions I experimented a little with different stylistic choices and language features, so quality might vary a little.
