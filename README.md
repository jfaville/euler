![Progress on Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/profile/jfaville.png)
This repository contains solutions to miscellaneous problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

##Programming Languages
Solutions are written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) and in Python 3, and are separated by language into two subdirectories. The easiest way to the CoffeeScript files is with the ``coffee`` command (see [http://coffeescript.org/#installation](this guide)) for installation details), but they can also be compiled to Javascript files.

##Status
These solutions were made for fun, and all were able to produce the answer to the given problem. In some solutions I experimented a little with different stylistic choices and language features, so quality might vary a little.
