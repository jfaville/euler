Utility Methods

generalize = (func) -> (base, reducends...) -> 
    if not reducends? then [base, reducends...] = base
    reducends.reduce func, base
sum = generalize (a, b) -> a + b
square = (a) -> a*a

###
SUM SQUARE DIFFERENCE
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, 

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
